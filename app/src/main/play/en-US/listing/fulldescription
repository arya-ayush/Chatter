Gitter is a popular chat website for open source projects.
Unfortunately Gitter's chat app is a web-based app, meaning it is slow and doesn't save chats offline.

Chatter solves this problem by bringing a native solution to Gitter.
Your chats are saved offline and the app is as fast as any other native app.

Chatter is Free and Open Source Software.
